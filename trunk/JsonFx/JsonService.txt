I want to create a code generator which will take a normal service class and allow it to be decorated with attributes to generate a JSON-RPC interface.
It would be similar to what VS2005 does for WebServices so that Ajax apps could just call it.

JSON-RPC is to SOAP WebService, as JSON is to XML
- JSON-RPC spec: http://json-rpc.org/wd/JSON-RPC-1-1-WD-20060807.html
- JSON spec: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt

I think others are working on it but I'd want it to be as seamless as possible and most others don't do a good job.
There are three out there which I should prob look at first:
- ASP.NET AJAX: http://ajax.asp.net/docs/default.aspx
- Jayrock: http://jayrock.berlios.de/
- JSON.NET: http://www.newtonsoft.com/products/json/

It will be C# based and generate Javascript stubs from C# services
And it will have a JS layer to abstract away the communication
It will basically create a service object that is just a proxy javascript object for marshalling like the WebServices are in C#
Then an Ajax app can just reference it as if it is a local class

ASP.NET creates a WebServiceContract class which is a generic communication block with a WebService of any sort
Then they inherit from it and put all the methods that apply to [webmethod] decorated functions in the actual web service implementation
This will have to do something similar but generate it for the Javascript side.

Ultimately it is part of an Ajax framework that is really lightweight but powerful
At first at least, it will require the UI to be built in XHTML/CSS with JS glue and the services to be in C#
I want it to be independent of any app but more like what ASP.NET does for web services
Then I will be able to build my stuff without the need to rely upon the complexity/limitations of these other frameworks
An Ajax framework shouldn't try to shield you from OO-Javascript, it should leverage it.
